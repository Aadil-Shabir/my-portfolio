        answer: `I am AB Memon, originally from Hala New, a small town in the Matiari District, Sindh. I completed my primary education at The Citizens Foundation (TCF) School in Hala. In the 8th grade, I moved to Cadet College Petaro in Jamshoro, where I studied until the 12th grade, receiving both academic education and military training.

Following my time at Cadet College, I pursued a degree in Business and Social Studies at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Islamabad. During my first year at NUST, I recognized the importance of acquiring specialized skills to shape my career. This realization led me to explore various fields, including Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Web Development.

I found a particular passion for Web Development and crafted a structured learning roadmap. I engaged in extensive self-study through platforms like Udemy and YouTube, gradually mastering web development. Armed with these skills, I began seeking opportunities on Upwork, thus embarking on my journey as a professional web developer.`,
